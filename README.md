# Quantum EPs

An exploration of **exceptional points (EPs)** in quantum systems using **Gaussian Process Regression models**.

This project is based on the open-source [Search-for-EPs](https://github.com/Search-for-EPs/Search-for-EPs) package, with only the core logic included for custom experimentation, learning, and reproducibility.
